## Desription of the project ##
In the project, we are going to implement a modern trivia quiz game where users can create their own questions or solve the questions already prepared by other users or programmers. We aim to create create this game using the principles of object-oriented programming. The game will be implemented in Java.

## How to execute the software ##
In order to execute the software, the user should create a localhost in MySQL which includes the tables used in database methods (friends, generalknowledgequestions, sciencequestions, geographyquestions, historyquestions, question, savedquestions, sportsquestions,userinfo) with appropriate rows. The user should add the information of port, username, and password in the places located in DatabaseConnection class. Also, users should launch maven and javafx to run the program after setting the database.
